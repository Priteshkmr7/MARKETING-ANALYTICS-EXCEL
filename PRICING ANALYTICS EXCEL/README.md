# ðŸ’¸ Pricing Excel Models

This folder showcases my hands-on work in Pricing Analytics using Microsoft Excel. The models reflect a blend of economic theory, marketing insights, and spreadsheet-based decision-making. 
Each file demonstrates a different pricing strategy applied through real-world scenarios and Solver-based optimization.
These models are based on concepts taught by **Swagato Chatterjee â€“ NPTEL**,**Haytham Omar â€“ Udemy** and **Linkedin Learning**, and were implemented and adapted by me to understand real-world pricing scenarios across various industries.
## ðŸ“‚ Contents

| File Name | Pricing Concept | Description |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| `Linear_Demand_Model.xlsx` | Linear Pricing | Models the demand curve as a straight line to find the profit-maximizing price and quantity. |
| `Power_Demand_Model.xlsx` | Power Curve Pricing | Uses a power demand function to estimate more realistic non-linear demand behavior. |
| `Bundle_Pricing.xlsx` | One-Price Bundling | Maximizes revenue by offering two products as a single bundle to different customer segments. |
| `Price_Skimming.xlsx` | Dynamic Pricing | Implements a price skimming strategy for product launches with high early demand. |
| `Capital_Item_Pricing.xlsx` | Razor-Blade Model | Applies two-part pricing (durables + consumables) using the classic razor-and-blade strategy. |
| `Electricity_Block_Pricing.xlsx` | Block Pricing | Simulates slab-based pricing commonly used in utilities like electricity or water. |

## ðŸ§  Key Skills Demonstrated

- Demand Curve Modeling (Linear, Power, Subjective)
- Pricing Strategy Simulation
- Profit Maximization
- Excel Solver Optimization
- Excel Functions (VLOOKUP, Data Tables, IF, INDEX-MATCH)

## ðŸ§° Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
- **Solver** for constrained optimization
- **Data Tables** for scenario analysis
- **Excel Charts** for visual pricing insights


Pricing is a critical lever for both revenue and profit. These models demonstrate my capability to:
- Translate business objectives into spreadsheet models
- Apply theory to real-world pricing problems
- Communicate data-driven pricing recommendations clearly
